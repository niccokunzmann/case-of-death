# Software Will

**Q&amp;A for how to deal with my software in case I die**

I maintain a lot of little projects. I even if I do not answer staight away.
If you believe that I am absent from work for 6 months and you would like to take over maintainership, please open an **issue** saying:

> **New Maintained Fork**
>
> I am willing to take over this project. If @niccokunzmann did not respond after 6 months to this issue, consider this:
> ... your link goes here ... as the new maintained fork.
> This is based on https://github.com/niccokunzmann/case-of-death/

With this, the community can gather around to find a solution to their problems. I will be notified, too, so I can make sure you do not think I am dead :) In either case, I appreciate your enthusiasm :) Hehe

## What does not happen

I will not give over maintenance of releases and documentation AFTER death. Such, you will need to set that up. If you depend on my project, you can make sure that it is maintained well and the bus factor (maintainer count) is increased. Just reach out.

## Why

Open-Source software is exploited by capitalist interest without responsibility for its and our well-being. These are many sources that found this.
This document intends to solve questions around maintenance and process for people to join up to collaborate on new releases to my software.
We need to come together as a community to look at our health beyond code. This is one of my individual attempts. However, there is more!

## Contributing

You can contribute to this in many ways:

- Give this a star if you think having such a repo is a good idea.
- Give this a fork and pin it, adapt it to your needs.
- Open an issue to clarify if you think this process is problematic and should be amended.
